## Overview

This is a BIDS Microscopy dataset, generated by the SPIMprep workflow.

The OME-Zarr format is used to store a pre-processed and stitched selective-plane illumination microscopy (SPIM, aka lightsheet microscopy) dataset. Downsampled nifti images are also produced in the derivatives folder.

## TODO

 - [ ] include methods description and links/references
 - [ ] point to where any config/reports are located (need to generate these still)..
